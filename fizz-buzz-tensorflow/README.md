if you're interested in the WrangleConf talk I gave, look in the `wrangle` folder.

if you're interested in the PyData Chicago talk I gave, look in the `pydata-chicago` folder

if you're interested in the ODSC West talk I gave, also look in the `pydata-chicago` folder, it's the exact same code (but fresher slides!)
